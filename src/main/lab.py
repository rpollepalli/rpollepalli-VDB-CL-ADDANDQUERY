An LLM in a RAG application is intended to acquire some persona
that is built on top of the existing baseline LLM. This means that the LLM will need
to be aware of human-written documents that define important information about your
organization, such as
    - standard operating procedures
    - technical reference documents
    - legal documents
    - marketing materialAn
An LLM needs to be granted the ability to retrieve these documents
when they are relevant to the AI's actions. We may determine the relevancy of documents
using a 'vector search', which may mathematically comparing the pre-generated
'embeddings' of a document against the tokens contained in a prompt.

ChromaDB will be used here as our vector database. Your curricula may reference a
different Vector offering, but Chroma is lightweight and may be used locally.
Below, the Chroma collection for this lab is established. A Collection can be thought of
as a grouping of related documents, and can be treated similarly to a database table.

Below is a function that adds some documents contained in the resources folder
to a locally-stored vector database, ChromaDB. ChromaDB will automatically generate
the embeddings needed for a document. It will then query the database for the
most relevant document to the query "How is singles different from doubles?", which
should be identified as being related to the Tennis document.
